# MAS_Project

# Initialize project steps:
- Download Genius from: [TU Delft](http://ii.tudelft.nl/genius/?q=article/releases)
- Rename 'genius\<version\>.jar' to 'genius.jar'
- Place this .jar file in the /lib folder. The project should recognize it and the run configuration should be functioning.

# Adding/modifying new agents:
In the /src folder new agents can be created (example agents from Genius have been included)

# Running Genius
On the top right in IntelliJ, the 'Genius Run' run configuration should be available, run this and Genius will execute with any changes.
